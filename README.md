# This project is designed to predict house prices based on various features using machine learning techniques.

# Overview
This project demonstrates how to use machine learning to predict house prices. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. You can use this code as a starting point for your own house price prediction project.

# Dependencies
Before you start, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (3.7 or higher)
Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for running the provided Jupyter notebook)
Required Python libraries (install using pip):
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install Python libraries using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
Change your current directory to the project folder:
bash
Copy code
cd house-price-prediction
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook house_price_prediction.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and make predictions.
# Project Structure
house_price_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and detailed explanations.
data/: Folder containing the dataset (e.g., house_data.csv).
README.md: This file.
# Data
The dataset (data/house_data.csv) contains information about houses and their sale prices. Make sure the dataset is available in the data/ directory.

# Model
The code includes a simple Linear Regression model by default. You can explore other regression models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.) by modifying the code in the Jupyter Notebook.

# Results
You can view the model's performance and house price predictions in the Jupyter Notebook.
